# MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE LESSON PLANS

## INTRODUCTION

The notebooks and python scripts here follow from the A-Level Mathematics lessons that I have taught using Jupyter Notebook and Python programming. This is a growing library so will be updated frequently with additional lessons.

#### A-LEVEL MATHEMATICS

1. [Rational Functions and their graphs](https://github.com/dave2k77/comp_math/blob/main/Rational%20Functions%20and%20their%20Graph.ipynb)
2. [Nonlinear Functions 1](https://github.com/dave2k77/comp_math/blob/main/NonlinearFunctions-1.ipynb)
3. [Nonlinear Functions 2](https://github.com/dave2k77/comp_math/blob/main/NonlinearFunctions-2.ipynb)
4. [The Binomial Theorem](https://github.com/dave2k77/comp_math/blob/main/The_binomial_theorem.ipynb)
5. [Implementing and testing functions arising in the binomial theorem](https://github.com/dave2k77/comp_math/blob/main/binomial.py)
6. [Statistical Analysis](https://github.com/dave2k77/comp_math/blob/main/Summarising_Describing_Data.ipynb)
